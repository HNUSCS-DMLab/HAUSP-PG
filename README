HUSPM
This repo hosts the codes of papers related to high-average-utility sequential pattern mining (HAUSPM).

Requirements
Java programming language.

Running the program
A simple way is to run the java test file.

Benchmarks
The data format used is the same as the provided dataset files. That is, different positive integers represent different terms. In addition, "-1" is used as the itemset separator and "-2" is used as the sequence separator.
Additional datasets can be accessed from SPMF.
Introduction
HAUSP-PG: A HAUSPM algorithm which was inspired by HUSPM algorithm HUSPM-SP (https://github.com/DSI-Lab1/HUSPM). Moreover, two variants of upper bound models on average utility, namely vPEAU and vTRSAU are proposed in HAUSP-PG.
